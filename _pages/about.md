Hi, thank you for stopping by! I am a `design researcher` currently working in the [Ideation Lab](http://ideation.mit.edu/) (PI: Dr. Maria Yang) at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to MIT, I received a PhD and MS both in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (Advisors: Dr. Jonathan Cagan and Dr. Kenneth Kotovsky) and a BS in Mechanical Engineering at Rice University.

My research primarily focuses on `human-computer collaboration` in engineering design. I am interested in understanding how the integration of computational tools/agents in the engineering design process affects the way `designers think, feel, and make creative decisions`, a.k.a. design. I also explore opportunities for human designers to contribute effectively to the collaboration to promote `human-centered design`. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
