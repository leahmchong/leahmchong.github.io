Hi, I am a `design researcher` at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, working in the [Ideation Lab](http://ideation.mit.edu/) (PI: Dr. Maria Yang). Prior to MIT, I received a PhD and MS both in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (Advisors: Dr. Jonathan Cagan and Dr. Kenneth Kotovsky) and a BS in Mechanical Engineering at Rice University.

My research primarily focuses on `human-AI collaboration` in engineering design. I am interested in: <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**1)** Understanding how the integration of computational tools/agents in the engineering design process affects the way **designers think, feel, and make creative decisions**, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**2)** Exploring opportunities for complementary partnership between human designers and AI to enable **effective and human-centered design**.
<br><br>

##### <span style="color:purple"> Starting Spring 2025, I will be joining [the Walker Department of Mechanical Engineering at UT Austin](https://www.me.utexas.edu/) as an assistant professor. </span>
**I am actively seeking motivated students (undergrad, MS, PhD) to join my research group.** If you are interested in joining, please email me at **leah.chong@austin.utexas.edu** including the following information: <br> * Your up-to-date CV <br> * Specific descriptions of the research idea you have/would like to work on that relates to my research area <br> * The position you are seeking and whether you are seeking a funded or unfunded position

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
